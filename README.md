This was the final project of a support bootcamp I completed three months ago, provided by PiA Group.
During the bootcamp, which was focused on IT support, we were tasked with developing a final project as part of the program.

As part of this project, I worked on creating simple microservices and attempted to connect them to an e-commerce site. However, since backend-level coding was not required, the functionalities remained somewhat limited.
